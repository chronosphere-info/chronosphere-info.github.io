              <p class="lead">Researchers focusing on global-scale ecological and evolutionary patterns are faced with the overwhelmingly increasing volume and diversity of data compilations. Finding these data and incorporating them in the analytical workflow  to answer relevant research questins can be time consuming and often lead to difficulties and conflicts in version control. </p>

<p class="lead">The goal of the ‘chronosphere’ project is to offer a portal to these data sources and to allow their immediate use by compiling frequently accessed representations on a server that keeps track of different versions. These data are available through an R package of the same name (available on the CRAN servers), that downloads a specific version of a dataset and attaches it to the R environment. The package focuses on data used in biogeography, macroecology and macroevolution, from large datasets to small tables published as supplementary information to research articles..</p>

            <p>Get started with your project by accessing all the data that you need without leaving your R environment. Check out our <a href="{{ "/docs/home/" | relative_url }}">documentation</a> for a list of data already available. There is no need anymore to navigate through multiple databases to access your data.
