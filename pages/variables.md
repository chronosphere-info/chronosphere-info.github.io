A variable is a function that maps one type of information to another. 

The blueprint of a variable is its dimensionality: the dimensions of its **domain** (to what it maps things) and its **range** (what it maps). The entire Earth system can represented with a set of variables or system descriptors. 

## Examples

### Seawater temperature (atmosphere)

*Seawater Temperature* is a variable that maps a single value (range: Â°K), to four dimensions (domain: longitude, latitude, elevation and absolute time).

- HADIsst1
- IPCC AR6 WG1 Atlas - CMIP6 
- BRIDGE climate data

### Global richness of genera (biosphere)

This variable (range: # of genera), domain (absolute time, set of organisms). 

- Sepkoski's genus level diversity curves

## Relationship to data items 

The basic idea of the chronosphere is that every [data product]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/) can be described as a manifestation of a variable, i.e. it becomes a value that it takes. 




We can trace how our understanding of the Earth System evolves in a secondary (knowledge) time dimension.
