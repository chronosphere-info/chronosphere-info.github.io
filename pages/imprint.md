### Imprint (temporary)

The website itself is in an alpha-state: it is actively developed, which means that some features are not yet functional. Accessibility issues are known and are getting patched. 

The site was made by [Ádám T. Kocsis](https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/people/instructors/kocsis/), to whom all questions about it should be addressed. 

### Used software

The **chronosphere** website is built using the open-source content management software [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on the [Bulma Clean Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme) by CS Rhymes and on the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework. The website uses javascript frameworks from [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [datatables.net](https://datatables.net/) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).
